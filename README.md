# 🏜️ Western Console Game

**Western Console Game** is a simple, humorous text-based adventure built in Python. You play as a dusty wanderer trying to survive a small wild west town. Your main goal? Feed and hydrate your poor, scruffy donkey so you can finally leave this miserable place!

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You start with 3 coins and a big dream: to get your horse (well, more like a donkey) some **food (20 coins)** and **water (15 coins)**. To earn money, you can:

- 🎰 Gamble at the bar
- 🧑‍⚖️ Visit the sheriff's office (maybe commit a crime?)
- 🐴 Head to the stable and spend your hard-earned cash

But be careful—messing with criminals or robbing the sheriff can get you killed. And if you die... well, you won't be leaving the town, and neither will your donkey.

## 🔧 How I Made It

This project was made by [@enka31](https://github.com/enka31) as a mini-practice project to improve my Python fundamentals. I used:

- `input()` and `print()` for text-based interaction
- `random` for unpredictable outcomes
- Global variables to track game state
- Functions to separate gameplay logic
- Simple `while` and `if` loops for flow control

It was a fun way to combine programming practice with storytelling!
